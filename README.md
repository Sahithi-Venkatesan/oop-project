It also has additional features which help you to post your queries, take part in discussions through a discussion forum, know the statistics of the COVID positive cases across the globe,also regarding the precautions to be taken during this pandemic and myth busters.

The best part of Drishti is that it can handle things without even without a typical database. It can handle things pretty well using csv and text files. 
This has been made as a part of an Academic Project.
